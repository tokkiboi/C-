/* LAB 4
Write a C++ program to aid the DeAnza Bookstore in estimating its business for next
quarter.Experience has shown that sales depend on whether a book is required or
suggested, and on whether or not it has been used before.A new, required book will sell
to 90 % (.90) of expected enrollment, but if it has been used before only 65 % of the
expected enrollment will buy it.Similarly, 40 % of the expected enrollment will buy a
newly suggested book, but only 20 % will purchase a previously suggested book.

Your program is to prompt the user for:
- the book's 10 digit ISBN number (store as a string)
- the list price per copy
- the expected class enrollment
- code of 'R'for required text or code of 'S' for suggested text
- code of 'N' for a new text or code of 'O' for a text that has been used the previous
quarter
CALCULATE
Calculate the number of copies needed and the profit if the store pays 80% of list (use
global define for this). For the number of books to order, round up to the nearest whole
book.Use one function to calculate number of books, one function to calculate the profit,
and one function to output.
OUTPUT A sample run might look like this:
Enter book number: 0755798652
Enter price per copy: 34.98
Enter expected class enrollment: 35
Enter 'R' if required or 'S' if suggested: r
Enter 'N' if new or 'O' if not a new text: O

ISBN: 0755798652
Copies Needed: 23
Profit: $ 160.91
