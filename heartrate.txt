/*

The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that you maintain your training heart rate during
an aerobic workout.Your traing heart rate is computed as .7 * (220  a) + .3 * r,
where a is your age and r is your resting heart rate(your pulse when you first awaken).
Write a program to prompt and input a persons age and resting heart rate.
Calculate the training heart rate using a separate function.Call this function from main().
Output this value using a function which is also called from main(). */
